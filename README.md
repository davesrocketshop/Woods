Woods material database

## Quick Start

Normally the user is required to do nothing other than install the module. The materials then become available for use in FreeCAD.

In the event materials need to be generated, you can run the Python code:

 $ python Utilities\spreadsheet.py

Required Python modules:
- openpyxl
- opencv-python
- pillow
